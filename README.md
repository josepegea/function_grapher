# Graph - An example app using Ruby and TK

## Installing

### macOS

You need to install Tcl/Tk in your Mac.

According to https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html it seems that
the best option is, ATM, the community edition of ActiveState at
https://www.activestate.com/products/tcl/downloads/

You need to register for free in order to download the installer.

Once done, you can run `bundle install` and it should be ready. In my
case, it failed the first time but repeating the command worked.
